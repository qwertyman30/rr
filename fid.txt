Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) is a metric used to evaluate the similarity between two sets of images. It is particularly used to compare the quality of images generated by generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), with the original images.

FID is based on the Fréchet Distance, which is a measure of the distance between two probability distributions. In the case of FID, the two distributions being compared are the distribution of feature vectors extracted from the original images and the distribution of feature vectors extracted from the generated images.

The feature vectors are obtained by passing the images through a pre-trained Inception v3 neural network, which is trained to classify images. The output of the intermediate layer of the network is used as the feature vector for each image.

To calculate FID, the mean and covariance of the feature vectors are calculated for both the original and generated image sets. Then, the Fréchet Distance between the two distributions is calculated using the following formula:

FID = ||mu1 - mu2||^2 + Tr(Cov1 + Cov2 - 2*(Cov1*Cov2)^1/2)

where mu1 and mu2 are the means of the feature vectors for the original and generated image sets, Cov1 and Cov2 are the covariance matrices of the feature vectors for the original and generated image sets, and Tr() is the trace of a matrix.

FID measures the similarity between the original and generated image sets. A lower FID value indicates a higher similarity and, thus, a higher quality of the generated images. FID is a widely used metric for evaluating the performance of generative models, particularly in the field of computer vision.
